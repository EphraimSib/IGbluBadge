#This script is a tool for checking if you are root and then running a local web server to catch Instagram credentials.

#Principle:
#The script first checks if you are root by looking for the `/root` directory in the `os.geteuid()` function. If you are root, it will display a green message. If not, it will display a red message.

#After checking if you are root, the script will prompt you to enter a port number (between 1024 and 65535) to run the local web server. It will then create a custom request handler to respond with a simple message.

#The script will then initialize the Chrome, open the Instagram login page, and enter your username and password. It will wait for the login process to complete, and then check if the user has a blue badge (verified account) on Instagram.

#If the user has a blue badge, it will print a success message and log the event. If not, it will print an error message and log the error.

#Finally, the script will close the browser, generate a link to the local web server, and serve the server forever.

#Usage:
# use this script, simply run it in your terminal or command prompt. The script will prompt you for your Instagram credentials and the port number for the local web server.
